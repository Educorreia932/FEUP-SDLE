How to run the project:

1. Install maven (tested with version 3.6.3)
2. run mvn package
3. Last step generates two jars in the target directory: testApp.jar and broker.jar

broker.jar can be run as is without any arguments:

java -jar target/broker.jar
The broker will output a topics.ser file which contains its internal state. On startup the broker will try to read this state. If this is not desired the state file must be deleted.


testApp can be either a subscriber or a publisher depending on the arguments.
It can be called like:

java -jar testApp.jar <Pub|Sub> <id> (<Topic> <Amount>)*

The first argument specifies if the testApp will work as a Publisher or a Subscriber
The second argument specifies an arbitrary string to serve as the testApp id.
The following arguments specify the amount of times the testApp will try to GET or PUT a random string to a specific Topic.

Some examples:

testApp.jar Pub pub1 sapo 15 batata 5 -> will PUT to sapo 15 times and to batata 5 times
testApp.jar Sub sub1 sapo 10 -> will GET from sapo 10 times

For subscribers the testApp will automatically subscribe to the desired topic at the beginning and unsubscribe at the end.
